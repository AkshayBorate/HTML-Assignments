      New Yorkâ€™s iconic Central Park was designed in 1858 by F.L Olmsted and C.
      Vaux, having been chosen in a competition against 32 other entries. The
      competition called for the design of a park including a parade ground,
      fountain, watchtower, skating arena, four cross streets, and room for an
      exhibition hall.
